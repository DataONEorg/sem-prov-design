DataONE Run Manager and API for Capturing Provenance in Script Executions
=========================================================================

Overview
--------

Scientists need a way to easily capture provenance for their data processing and analysis and have 
an automated way to search and share provenance and derived data products from their analysis.

An approach to capturing provenance with minimal impact on a scientist processing and analysis workflow is with 
a run manager that manages all the details of recording and storing data provenance.  A run manager will
capture provenance while a script is running, requiring no modification to the scientist's scripts.  The run 
manager will determine provenance relationships between objects related to a script execution and record those 
relationships in a standard format.

This document specifies the Run Manager API that details functions to capture, search, review,
archive and share data provenance. 

The initial ideas for the Run Manager were developed during the session “Provenance Capture in R” at Open Science Codefest in 2014, 
as well as a 2014 Community Dynamics working group meeting, and other DataONE Semantics and Provenance Working Group discussions.

Several use cases for storing provenance have been outlined: UseCases_

.. _`record()`:

*record(filePath)*

The record method executes the specified script and records the files read and created by the script. 
In-memory objects need to be considered also. It's possible that a script never writes to disk, but just
creates an in-memory final product. This may be specified in a configuration API
Provenance relationships for the script execution are automatically determined based on the run 
manager’s built-in knowledge of the provenance ontology.

The record method creates and returns a DataONE DataPackage object that contains the provenance relationships and derived data 
objects for a single script invocation. 

Since record() returns the DataPackage, the DataPackage can be viewed and manipulated before publishing. For example, 
members of the package can be removed, new objects (such as scientific metadata) can be added, and relationships can be manually inserted via *insertRelationship()*.
Note: *insertRelationShip* is a method in DataPackage.R.
The *record()* method should return the runId of the recorded run, and then the Run class should allow the user to get any DataPackages produced, etc.

The *record()* method will archive input files instead of inserting them into the package created for a run. An input file might be read by many
different runs and storing the same input file in a data package for each run is inefficient and may waste disk space. The Run Manager
file archive should store an input file once, but allow it to be referred to by any number of runs. Each input file should be easily
accessible by the Run Manager, for example when a run is published.

The following diagram shows a single invocation of record() and how provenance would be captured for reading a CSV file:

.. image:: ../use-cases/provenance/images/sequence-41.png

.. _`startRecord()`:

*startRecord(tag)*

Recording is started immediately from the current processing context. A character string *tag* can be specified that will be associated with the 
current execution. The string specified for *tag* can be any string that has meaning to the user, and can be used by other functions 
to select executions for listing, deletion or other operations.

Provenance collection will continue for this execution until the *endRecord()* call is issued.

The use of the *startRecord()* and *endRecord()* functions is an alternative to using the *record()* funciton. Using this alternative approach
may be appropriate when finer grained control is required that is provided by *record()* or for use with interpreted languages such as R where the user
is working in the console and wished to record provenance for processing performed in the console environment.

The *startRecord()* method should archive input files as described for *record()*.

.. _`endRecord()`:
  
*endRecord()*

Recording is stopped, execution information is persisted to disk and a data package is finalized and returned to the caller. Any cached information
in memory is erased and any subsequent calls to *startRecord()* will begin a new execution.

.. _`listRuns()`:
 
*listRuns()*

The *listruns* function retrieves information for recorded script exections 
and outputs this information
to the display.

Output values:

* scriptName - the script used to invoke a run, the argument passed to *record(fileName)*
* startTime - the date and time when *record()* was called
* endTime - the date and time when *record()* ended
* publishedTime - the date and time that the package from this run was uploaded to DataONE
* runId - the unique identifier for this execution
* packageId - the unique identifier for the DataONE data package created by an execution
* errorMessage - an error message that caused processing to terminate

Below is an example of the output from the *listRuns* function:

::

This information will also be returned to the calling function as a data structure.

.. _`deleteRuns()`:
 
*deleteRuns(runIdList, startDateTime, endDateTime, tags, noop, quiet)*

Locally archived information for executions that match the input arguments is deleted. For *runIdList*, each execution with
a matching execution identifier is deleted. Executions after *startDateTime* and before *endDateTime* 
inclusive, are deleted. The argument *tags* can be specified using wildcard charaters, and any executions
with matching tags are deleted. The arguments *runIdList* and *tags* are processed separately, so the
relationship between them can be considered a logical AND, as it relates to the set of executions that
are deleted. Information about each deleted execution is printed to the display, unless the argument
*quiet* is TRUE.

The argument *noop* causes *deleteRuns* to display matching executions without deleting them.

.. _`publish()`:

*publish(DataPackage, Client)*

The publish function will reserve DataONE identifiers for each member of the DataPackage using the 
DataONE REST API. The DataPackage that was initially created by *record()* will be recreated using these identifiers.

If the script execution used an existing DataONE object as an input (determined 
by looking for functions such as *getD1Object()* in R), then this object will not 
be aggregated in this DataPackage, but will still be referred to in provenance relationships, such as prov:used.

The complete DataPackage will be uploaded to a repository using the specified D1Client.
A configuration API will allow the scientist to set default properties like AccessPolicy, ReplicationPolicy, etc.

It may be useful for the publish() function to include a parameter for the ID format, such as a preferred DOI prefix.
Identifier creation will be configurable so the scientist have control over the format of the identifiers that they create.
  
.. _`view()`:

*view(packakeId)*

This function can be called after *record()* and before *publish()* as an easy way to preview a DataPackage 
before publishing. Warnings and other messages can be displayed, such as “Warning: There is no 
scientific metadata in this data package.” The output of view() initially be implemented text output, but it may 
be worth considering a GUI for viewing the DataPackage, such as with Shiny in R.

The *view()* outputs:

A list of members of the DataPackage
A list of the relationships between members in the DataPackage

The following is example output from the the view() function:

.. _`get()`:

*get(configuration, name)*

The get method retrieves the value of the named parameter in the given Configuration. Parameters names can be any string, many of which are listed in the categories above in the `set()`_ command.

.. _`saveConfig()`:

*saveConfig(configuration, path)*

Save all of the configuration parameters in the current Configuration to disk, given the path to a file. The
path defaults to ~/.d1/configuration.json.

.. _`loadConfig()`:

*loadConfig(path)*

Load all of the configuration parameters from a saved Configuration on disk from the given path. Returns the
Configuration object. The path defaults to ~/.d1/configuration.json.

.. _`listConfig()`:

*listConfig()*

List all of the configuration parameters from the loaded configuration as structured object, depending on the script language.

.. _`getMetadata()`:

*getMetadata(runId, seq)*

Retrieve the metadata object for the specified run so that it can be inspected and manually edited if desired. The run identifier
or sequence identifier for the run can be specified, and the metadata object for the corresponding run will be retrieved. This
assumes that only one metadata object will be maintained for a run by run manager, and that run manager knows which object
is the metadata object for a run.

.. _`putMetadata()`:

*putMetadata(runId, seq, file)*

Replace the metadata object for the specified run, specifying the run either with the run identifier, or the sequence number
for the run.

Run Manager Provenance Capture
------------------------------

The run manager overloads functions that read input and write output in 
order to capture the objects that are used and 
generated by the script execution. For example, when a script reads in a .csv file, the 
run manager can infer the triple “script execution -> prov:used -> .csv file”. 

The following provenance relationshps will be recorded:

- wasGeneratedBy
  
  When an output is created by the script execution, the run manager can infer that the ouput “prov:wasGeneratedBy” the script execution.
  
  Detection: The run manager will overload R functions such as write.csv and createD1Object() to capture the data file the script execution generates.
- used
  
  When the script execution reads input data, it can infer that the script execution “prov:used” the input data.
  
  Detection: The run manager will overload R functions such as getD1Object() and read.csv().
- wasDerivedFrom
  
  After the “prov:wasGeneratedBy”  and “prov:used” relationships are created, we can infer that a data object 
  generated by this script execution “prov:wasDerivedFrom” the inputs the script “prov:used”
- wasInformedBy
  
  When the script initially executed by record() invokes another script, the run manager can infer 
  that the initial execution  “prov:wasInformedBy” the other script execution it triggered.
  
  Detection: The run manager will overload the R function source().

Generating and Modifying Data Object Metadata  
---------------------------------------------

.. _EMLpackage: https://github.com/ropensci/EML

.. _XMLSpy: http://www.altova.com/xmlspy.html

.. _Oxygen: http://www.oxygenxml.com

.. _EML: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/index.html

The Run Manager assists in the preparation of metadata that describe the objects associated with
an execution by using an investigator specified template that is
combined with values derived from the execution. 
The metadata generated by this process will be in the format specified by the Ecological Metadata Language
and will include these EML_ elements:

- title
- creator
- abstract
- contact
- publication date
- method description
- spatial coverage
- temporal coverage
- otherEntity 
	- an otherEntity element will be added for each file generated by a run
	- During the publish() call, the otherEntity/physical/distribution/online/url element value will be updated with the 
          URL for object being published using the specified membernode, provided that this element exists in the EML at
          the time publish() is run, and that a value has not already been entered for this element.
	- The entityName element value will be filed in with the filename of the object.

The location of the
template is set with the DataONE Session Configuration parameter *package_metadata_template_path*. If the 
investigator has not set this parameter then a default template will be used. 

The initial metadata object is created during the record() function, after which it will be 
available to be retrieved from the Run Manager cache. 
The function *getMetadata()* can then be used to retrieve the metadata object for a specified run.

The metadata can then be reviewed by the investigator for correctness, then manually edited and updated 
with additional or more detailed information using tools such as the EMLpackage_
from rOpenSci (for the R implementation of Run Manager) or an XML editor such as 
XMLSpy_ or Oxygen_. 

Once manual editing is completed for the metdata it can be reinserted into the Run Manager cache using
the *putMetadata()* function. 

This metadata will then be included with any data package that is assembled from a recorded execution, for example
when a package is prepared and uploaded to DataONE.
