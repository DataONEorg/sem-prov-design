# Run Management Examples

This directory contains various examples of run management output from different systems.

- Kepler: kepler-trace
    - includes a fully-specified workflow and a MOML document for run metadata
- R Run Manager: resourceMaps
    - this folder contains an example Resource Map that was created by the R Run Manager. This example contains required ORE triples and W3C Prov triples that describe the provenance for a simple R script execution that read one DataONE dataset and create one new DataONE dataset. The CITO triples for the relationships between a metadata document and the datasets that it documents are not included in this example.
