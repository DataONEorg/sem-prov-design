## Record Script Runs For Multiple Step Processing
A processing pipeline may involve multiple steps, with each processing step performed different
R scripts. In such a processing pipeline, each script might read files generated from a previous 
step and generates files that will be used by the next step. The R `recordr` package can record information for each
step in a multiple step pipeline and then retrieve this information for all scripts in the
pipeline, in order to review and possibly publish all scripts and associated data.

The example pipeline shown below contains three processing steps, with each step
implemented as an R script. Each step is run and recorded using the
recordr `record()` method:

```
rc <- new("Recordr")
record(rc, "get_analysis_rasters.R", tag="process rasters")
record(rc, "lsp_zonal_stats.R", tag="lsp zonal stats")
record(rc, "summarize_zonal_stats.R", tag="summarize zonal stats")

``` 
The `record()` method captures information about files that were used or generated by 
each script. This information is retrieved and used to display or perform operations
on the entire pipeline, using these recordr methods:

- `listRuns()`: display summary information about script runs
- `viewRuns()`: display detailed information about script runs 
- `graphRuns()`: display a graph of a processing pipeline
- `publishRuns()`: publish script runs to a repository

## Display Script Run Summary Information

Summary information can be listing for all scripts that have been recorded with the `record()` method.

To illustrate retrieving information for a specific processing pipeline and excluding unrelated script runs, a script
unrelated to the example pipeline is run:

```
record(rc, "EMCoverage.R", tag="first coverage run")
```

First, the `listRuns()` method is used to show all script executions that have been recorded with the `record` method.
By default, all script runs are shown, regardless of connections to other scripts. The rusn are listed in reverse 
chronological order base on `startTime` of a run, unless the `orderBy` parameter is used to specify a different column 
and sort type:
```
listRuns(rc)

Seq   Script                          Tag                        Start Time              Run Id        Published Time
4     EmCoverage.R                    forth coverage test        2017-03-01 15:53:08 PST ...2e94aa9f49 NA            
3     summarize_zonal_stats.R         summarize zonal stats      2017-04-30 12:41:30 PDT ...b92a5bc6e1 NA            
2     lsp_zonal_stats.R               lsp zonal stats            2017-04-28 12:41:28 PDT ...9317a45564 NA            
1     get_analysis_rasters.R          process rasters            2017-04-26 12:41:12 PDT ...e7c8fa91f7 NA

```

Next, `listRuns()` will be called to retrieve and show only scripts that are steps in the example pipeline.
Following the connections of common files between script runs is known as performing a data processing provenance trace.
In order to perform a trace and not simply a chronological list, the `direction` parameter is used. In the following
example the value `forward` is used to indicate that the trace proceeds in the direction of generated files, or descendants.
The starting location of the trace is indicated using the `seq` or `id` parameters to specify the run to start the
trace from:

```
listRuns(rc, seq=1, direction="forward")

Seq   Script                          Tag                        Start Time              Run Id        Published Time
3     summarize_zonal_stats.R         summarize zonal stats      2017-04-30 12:41:30 PDT ...b92a5bc6e1 NA            
2     lsp_zonal_stats.R               lsp zonal stats            2017-04-28 12:41:28 PDT ...9317a45564 NA            
1     get_analysis_rasters.R          process rasters            2017-04-26 12:41:12 PDT ...e7c8fa91f7 NA
```
The run for script 'EmCoverage.R' was not displayed, because there are no common files between this script and
the other scripts in the example pipeline.

As the trace proceeds, each descendant encounted is considered a "step", analogous to a
"generation" in geneology. The example pipeline has three steps, corresponding to the three
scripts that were run and recorded.

The trace can also proceed in the opposite direction by specifying `direction="backward"`.

A portion of the trace can be retrieved and displayed using the `steps` parameter:
```
listRuns(rc, seq=1, direction="forward", steps=1)

Seq   Script                          Tag                        Start Time              Run Id        Published Time
2     lsp_zonal_stats.R               lsp zonal stats            2017-04-28 12:41:28 PDT ...9317a45564 NA            
1     get_analysis_rasters.R          process rasters            2017-04-26 12:41:12 PDT ...e7c8fa91f7 NA
```

## Display Script Run Detailed Information

Detailed listings for each run in a trace can be viewed using the same arguments for `listRuns()`.
The following method call will retrieve all runs linked to the starting run and display each one, paging through the results:
```
viewRuns(rc, seq=1, direction="forward")o

## Display A Graph Of A Processing Pipeline

The entire pipeline can be viewed graphically using the `graphRuns()` method. This method begins the trace at the
specified run (`seq=1`) proceeds in a forward direction. A forward
search causes the trace to proceed to runs that are descendants of the current run.  For a forward search,
each file generated by a run is inspected and runs that used the file are considered for inclusion into the trace
as potential descendants. A reverse search looks for ancestors of each step.  These two trace
methods can be combined by specifying a trace direction of "both".

A graphical view of the processing workflow can be viewed using the `graphRuns()` method.
```
graphRuns(rc, seq=2, direction="forward")
```

## Publish Runs From a Pipeline
Runs from a pipeline can be published to a repository using the `publishRuns()` method. In the following example
the `publishRuns()` method arguments that are used perform the same provenance trace as the `graphRuns()` method shown earlier,
so that all runs for the example pipeline are published. By default, these runs are published in one package:
```
publishRuns(rc, seq=1, direction="forward", quiet=FALSE)

Publishing all runs in a single package:
  Including run "...b92a5bc6e1" (summarize zonal stats) to https://mn-dev.ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
  Including run "...9317a45564" (lsp zonal stats) to https://mn-dev.ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
  Including run "...e7c8fa91f7" (process rasters) to https://mn-dev.ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
Published package with identifier "7b49a634-6090-47ec-8f26-83c38aea2bc6" to https://mn-dev-ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
```
Alternatively, each runs can be published into a separate package by using the `combineRuns`
parameter (default value is `TRUE`).
```
publishRuns(rc, seq=1, direction="forward", quiet=FALSE, combineRuns=FALSE)

Published run "...b92a5bc6e1" (summarize zonal stats) with identifier "a778203a-4fdd-4286-947d-0fd1cacaf67f" to https://mn-dev-ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
Published run "...9317a45564" (lsp zonal stats) to with identifier "0a35a56f-1967-46f1-8266-2bea379137a4" to https://mn-dev-ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
Published run "...e7c8fa91f7" (process rasters) with identifeir "8f783aef-fa40-47c7-8b5b-cedc7f3d5f9e" to https://mn-dev-ucsb-1.test.dataone.org
