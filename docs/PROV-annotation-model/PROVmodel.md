Definitions
-----------
The DataONE PROV data model will be used to describe the relationships between:
* Derived resources and the original resources used to create them
* Data resources and the activities used to create them
* Programs (e.g. software, scripts) that were implemented to create a data resource

This data model uses the [W3C PROV Ontology and Data Model](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) to define classes of objects and the relationships between them. 

### Two classes and one subclass of objects are used in the DataONE PROV model:
1. **[Entity](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Entity)**
	* PROV-O definition: An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary.
	* DataONE: An entity is a [DataONE object](http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/overview.html), such as a data table, or scientific metadata.
2. **Entity Subclass [Plan](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Plan)**
	* PROV-O definition: A plan is an entity that represents a set of actions or steps intended by one or more agents to achieve some goals.
	* DataONE: A plan would most likely be a program, such as a script or code file.

Note:
> Since plans may evolve over time, it may become necessary to track their provenance, so plans themselves are entities. Representing the plan explicitly in the provenance can be useful for various tasks: for example, to validate the execution as represented in the provenance record, to manage expectation failures, or to provide explanations.

3. **[Activity](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Activity)**
	* PROV-O definition: An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.
	* DataONE: An activity represents a program execution and is stored as data about that execution.
	
	
**Note about [Agent](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Agent): ** 
	* DataONE may not capture information about agents during the first phase of the semantics and provenance work, but it is one of the major classes of the PROV-O ontology.
	* PROV-O definition: An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.

		
### The terms from the PROV ontology that will be used:
   * [prov:wasGeneratedBy] (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasGeneratedBy) : Generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an activity. This entity did not exist before generation and becomes available for usage after this generation.
   * [prov:wasDerivedFrom] (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom) : A derivation is a transformation of an entity into another, an update of an entity resulting in a new one, or the construction of a new entity based on a pre-existing entity.
   * [prov:used] (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#used) : Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an activity. Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity and could not have been affected by the entity.
   * [prov:wasInformedBy] (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasInformedBy) : Communication is the exchange of an entity by two activities, one activity using the entity generated by the other.
   * [prov:wasAssociatedWith] (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasAssociatedWith) : Attribution is the ascribing of an entity to an agent. prov:wasAssociatedWith is qualified by a [prov:Association](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#term-Association). An association must have at least one property: an id, an agent, a plan, or attributes. The DataONE PROV data model will include plans but will not include agents at this time.
   * [prov:hadPlan](http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#hadPlan) : hadPlan is a property of an Association (e.g. prov:wasAssociatedWith) that points to the prov:Plan implemented by a prov:Activity.
