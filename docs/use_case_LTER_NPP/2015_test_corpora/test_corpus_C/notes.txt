You need a list of all the datasets in Dataone that were

1. contributed by site=SBC (ie, not ecotrends)
2. came from pasta.



run this in a browswer, then save manually.

https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/search/eml?q=SBC&rows=1000

maybe I wasn't patient enough for:
curl -i -X GET https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/search/eml?q=SBC&rows=1000 > reconcile/pasta_sbcsolr.xml
but it kept spitting the first 10 records to the screen, with rows=null. so don't know.

THEN
grep packageId pasta_contents_sbc_20140422.xml | grep  knb-lter-sbc| cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d'<' -f1 | sort | uniq > sbc_docids.txt
 


THEN:
add these 5 on manually. they seem to not match the whole word SBC.
knb-lter-sbc.21.15
knb-lter-sbc.68.1
knb-lter-sbc.69.1
knb-lter-sbc.70.1
knb-lter-sbc.71.1
