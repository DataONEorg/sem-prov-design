MsTMIP and DataONE: A Science Workflow Scenario
===============================================

Improving scientific model sharing and communication through provenance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The North American Carbon Program's (NACP) Multiscale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) is a formal model intercomparison and evaluation effort focused on improving the diagnosis and attribution of carbon exchange at regional and global scales [1].  The MsTMIP effort is being used as a concrete scientific research scenario to evaluate tools being developed within the `DataONE`_ program to track and share scientific workflows and the products that are derived from them or other scientific efforts.

[Add more here. This paragraph will describe the overall steps in the MsTMIP workflow where we are applying the provenance use cases, starting from model driver data ingestion to the published figures, etc. Reference the overview image ...]

Step 1: Loading Driver Data
---------------------------

As researchers who prepare model driver data for MsTMIP using Matlab, we want to keep track of our data input files, data output files and scripts so we can review and compare our runs using different Carbon3/Carbon4 (C3C4) calculation algorithms. The Matlab ingestion script takes 3 data sets as inputs:

- North American 1/4-degree resolution land cover map
- monthly mean surface air temperature between 2000 and 2010
- monthly mean precipitation between 2000 and 2010

It will then calculate relative fractions of C3 and C4 grass in each 1/4-degree grid cell, and output the result as a ________.

Expected Inputs and Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Input script is MSTMIP-INPUT-SCRIPT-NAME (`C3_C4_map_present.m`_)

.. _`C3_C4_map_present.m`: https://github.com/DataONEorg/sem-prov-design/blob/master/docs/use-cases/provenance/example-files/mstmip/Driver/C3C4/C3_C4_map_present.m)


- `Input datasets`_ are MSTMIP-INPUT-DATASET-LIST
    - North American 1/4-degree resolution land cover map
    - monthly mean surface air temperature between 2000 and 2010
    - monthly mean precipitation between 2000 and 2010. 

.. _`Input datasets`: https://github.com/DataONEorg/sem-prov-design/tree/master/docs/use-cases/provenance/example-files/mstmip/Driver/C3C4/inputs)

- Input derived datasets are MSTMIP-INPUT-DERIVED-DATASET-LIST (Not applicable in this case)
    
- Input execution environment attributes are MSTMIP-INPUT-EXECUTION-ENVIRONMENT-ATTRIBUTE-LIST
    - Not applicable in this case

- Output recorded script execution is MSTMIP-OUTPUT-RECORDED-SCRIPT-EXECUTION-LIST
    - The list provided by DataONE

- Output provenance relationship list is MSTMIP-PROVENANCE-RELATIONSHIP-LIST 
    - The list provided by DataONE

- Output provenance relationship visualization is MSTMIP-PROVENANCE-RELATIONSHIP-VISUALIZATION
    - The visualization provided by DataONE

- Usability: Scientist can filter MSTMIP-OUTPUT-RECORDED-SCRIPT-EXECUTION-LIST 
    - by execution date, time, input dataset, input derived dataset, output dataset, ...

- Usability: scientist can view relationships between items in MSTMIP-PROVENANCE-RELATIONSHIP-LIST

- Usability: scientist can select desired MsTMIP data products and send them to DataONE
