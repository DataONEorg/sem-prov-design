DataONE Use Case 53 (Confirm Annotation)
==========================================

Owner confirms or refutes an annotation
--------------------------------------------------------------

Goal
----
Using a web UI, a user can confirm or refute existing annotations that were added either by a 3rd party or an automatic annotation process.

Scenario
--------
The owner of a given data package should have the ability to mark automatic annotations as correct (or incorrect) when reviewing the results of
automatic annotations.
Similarly, annotations from colleagues and other parties should be subject to the same review. TBD: reviews and comments about the quality of the data
rather than just the semantic concepts contained.

Actors
------
* Annotation library
* Member Node/Coordinating Node
* web UI for rendering metadata + annotations

Preconditions
-------------
* Datapackages with attribute-level metadata need to be registered in DataONE network
* The user must have write access to the object in order to approve or remove recommended annotations
* The user must have write access to the CN/MN to update annotations

Postconditions
--------------
* The updated annotations are stored on the Coordinating Node.
* The annotations are marked as being updated and verified by the user as applicable
