DataONE Use Case 53 (Reject Annotation)
==========================================

Owner rejects an annotation made by other person/process

Goal
----
Using a web UI, a user can reject annotations that were added either by a 3rd party or an automatic annotation process which are believed to
be erroneous.

Scenario
--------
The owner of a given data package should have the ability to mark automatic annotations incorrect when reviewing the results of
automatic annotations.
Similarly, annotations from colleagues and other parties should be subject to the same review.

Summary
-------
If an owner sees a incorrect annotation, they can mark it (reject it) at which point it should no longer inform query results.

	  end note

	  user -> user: review annotation	  
	  user --> webui: reject annotation

Actors
------
* Annotation library
* Member Node/Coordinating Node
* web UI for rendering metadata + annotations

Preconditions
-------------
* Datapackages with attribute-level metadata need to be registered in DataONE network
* The user must have write access to the object in order to reject recommended/3rd-party annotations
* The user must have write access to the CN/MN to update annotations

Postconditions
--------------
* The updated annotations are stored on the Coordinating Node.
* The annotations are marked as being rejected by the owner as applicable
* Index is updated to reflect the change in status of the annotation

Notes
-----
This is a simplified approach to our initial "confirm or refute annotation" plan. Until explicitly marked as incorrect,
all current annotations will be used to populate the search index for discovery. Ultimately, the owner of the original data package
has the final say in what is correct when it comes to annotations in the system.
