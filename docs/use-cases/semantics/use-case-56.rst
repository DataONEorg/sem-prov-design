DataONE Use Case 56 (Carbon cycle KR)
==========================================

Onotology for carbon cycle measurement concepts
-----------------------------------------------

Revisions
---------
2014-10-13: Created

Goal
----
Create ontology for carbon cycle/primay production concepts for use in annotating LTER data as well as MsTMIP model output.

Scenario
--------
Users must have a fully specified knowledge model for measurement types in the carbon cycle/ primary production realm
Given that we have found no pre-exisint comprehensive knowledge model for this domain, we will endeavor to create one.

Summary
-------
With input from daomin experts, a compete ontology will be created to capture measurement characteristics and standards in a 
way that clarifies MsTMIP variables and allows LTER to fully describe their observational data.
The ontology should fit modelling patterns outlined in one or more of:
* OBOE
* O&M (lite)
* other (TBD)

Preconditions
-------------

Postconditions
--------------
* A "complete" knowledge model that can be used to fully annotated LTER and MsTMIP datapackages.

Notes
-----
This isn't so much a use case as simply laying out the KR requirements.
