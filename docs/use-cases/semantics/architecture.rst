Semantic Architecture proposal
===================================

Author: Ben Leinfelder

Date: October, 2014: Initial draft of semantic architecture 

Goal: Describe components to be used and/or built to support semantic annotation 

Summary:
  
  This architecture attempts to re-use as many existing DataONE components as possible while also building on existing efforts in the 
  annotation realm
  This annotation model uses the [OA ontology](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) to describe
  the annotation assertions about metadata resources and fragments. PROV, FOAF, DCTERMS, and OBOE concepts are also utilized.
  There is ongoing investigation in the Open Knowledge Foundation's annotation tools, including: 
  [AnnotatorJS](http://annotatorjs.org/) and their [AnnotateIt](http://annotateit.org/) storage service. 
  
  
Overview
---------------------------------------
There will be a model for storing and communicating annotations.
There will be a mechanism for storing annotations.
There will be a component for indexing and querying annotations.

Model
------------------
The [OA ontology](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) will be used to capture and communicate annotations.

Proposed components
--------------------

  note left of webui: e.g., MetacatUI

  == Auto-generate annotations ==
  
  autoann -> store: getMetadata()
  store -> autoann: metadata
  note left
  	retrieve existing
  	metadata
  end note
  autoann -> ontrepo: getConcepts(metadata)e
  ontrepo -> autoann: concepts
  note right
  	Parse existing 
  	metadata to find
  	concept matches
  end note
  autoann -> autoann: generate annotation  
  autoann -> store: save(annotation)
  note left
  	Generated annotation
  	as OpeanAnnotation model
  	instance (likely RDF/XML)
  end note
  
  store --> triplestore
  note left
  	load OA model into triplestore
  end note
  triplestore --> index: fields
  note right
  	query triplestore
  	to populate index
  end note
   
  == Verify/Edit annotations ==
  
  store -> webui: metadata
  store -> webui: annotations
  note right
  	MetacatUI renders metadata;
  	Annotations displayed with
  	AnnotatorJS
  end note
  webui --> user: rendered metadata
  
  webui --> ontrepo: getConcepts()
  ontrepo --> webui: concepts
  note right
  	Concept recommendations
  	presented to user based 
  	on metadata content and/or
  	existing automated annotations
  end note
  user -> webui: annotate metadata
  webui -> store: save(annotation)
  note right
  	User confirms and/or edits
  	automated annotations
  end note
  
  store --> triplestore: annotation
  triplestore --> index: fields
  note left
  	Annotations reindexed 
  	as before
  end note
  
  == Query annotations ==
  
  webui -> index: query()
  index -> webui: search results
  note right
  	query against
  	semantic fields 
  	in index return 
  	metadata document
  	matches
  end note
  webui --> user: rendered results
