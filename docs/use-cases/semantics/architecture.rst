Semantic Architecture proposal
===================================

Author: Ben Leinfelder

Date: October, 2014: Initial draft of semantic architecture 

Goal: Describe components to be used and/or built to support semantic annotation 

Summary:
  
This architecture attempts to re-use as many existing DataONE components as possible while also building on existing efforts in the 
annotation realm
This annotation model uses the OA ontology (http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) to describe
the annotation assertions about metadata resources and fragments. PROV, FOAF, DCTERMS, and OBOE concepts are also utilized.
There is ongoing investigation in the Open Knowledge Foundation's annotation tools, including: 
AnnotatorJS (http://annotatorjs.org/) and their AnnotateIt (http://annotateit.org/) storage service. 
  
  
Overview
---------------------------------------
There will be a model for storing and communicating annotations.
There will be a mechanism for storing annotations.
There will be a component for indexing and querying annotations.

Model
------------------
The OA ontology (http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) will be used to capture and communicate annotations.
The serialization of this model can take multiple forms and can be included in other objects that may already be indexed by DataONE.
Some examples include:

* Atomic OA documents that contain one or more annotations (sserialized as RDF/XML and/or) JSON-LD
* Extended ORE documents	
* Embedded OA annotations in XML metadata (e.g., EML's additionalMetadata section)

We will initially focus on atomic annotation documents that can be parsed and loaded into a triplestore (which may or may not be persistent)
and that can then be queried to populate a discovery index (e.g., SOLR)

Notes:

The model proposal follows the OA specification as interpreted for our DataONE uses. 
Please review the section where the 'oa:hasBody' property is used to associate an OBOE concept as there are many possible
ways to reference OBOE concepts depending on the KR we use to define measurements, characteristics and standards.
Also, take note of how we are targeting the METADATA object using an xpointer to a specific part of the document (XML).
We have not endeavored to annotate DATA objects directly (e.g., tabular text/csv). In order to accommodate that, 
'oa:hasSource' would reference a data URI and the selector would be some alternative 'oa:Selector' subclass.

Annotation life-cycle
---------------------
This figure attempts to show the route that annotations take throughout
the system. First, automated annotations are generated from existing metadata,
then the annotation is saved to the object store, then an indexing process loads the 
Open Annotation model in a triplestore to use a semantic query to extract index fields
from it that are saved to the SOLR index.
Finally, the UI shows the search results and annotation details for further manual editing 
of the annotations.

Annotation components
----------------------
This diagram attempts to illustrate the different components involved in 
automatically generating annotations, saving them, indexing them, querying them, 
displaying them, and then editing them manually.
