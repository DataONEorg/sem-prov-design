Goal
----
To provide a traceable link to derived works for each dataset.

.. sidebar:: Scenario
    
    "As a scientist, I want to be able to find all derived datasets in DataONE that use my dataset so I can understand how my data are being used and by which colleagues."

Summary
-------
A scientist that has uploaded their dataset to DataONE and has allowed derived works in their intellectual rights statement can view and understand which derived works have used their dataset.

Actors
------
* Investigator
* Client software
* Member Node
* Coordinating Node

Preconditions
-------------
* The client software and user interface must be DataONE-enabled and provenance-aware.
* The synthetic and primary dataset(s) have been indexed by the DataONE Coordinating Nodes.
* The scientist who uploaded the synthetic dataset to a Member Node provided provenance information.
* The intellectual rights of the primary dataset allows for derived works.



Postconditions
--------------
* DataONE users can examine a list of derived works of each dataset.
