DataONE Use Case 44 (Explore Derived Data)
=============================

Scientists can examine original dataset(s) that were used to create a synthetic dataset found in DataONE.

Goal
----
Scientists examining a derived dataset in DataONE are able to determine which dataset(s) from DataONE Member Nodes were used in the derivation and can examine those source datasets.


.. sidebar:: Scenario
    
    "As a scientist, I want to be able to examine the original datasets used in a derived dataset Iâ€™ve found through DataONE so I can understand the history and composition of the derived dataset."

Summary
-------
A scientist that has searched for data relevant to their studies has found a synthetic dataset in DataONE.  They are able to view the relationships between the original and derived datasets, and can download the originals for examination.

Actors
------
* Investigator
* Client software
* Member Node
* Coordinating Node

Preconditions
-------------
* The scientist who uploaded the synthetic dataset to a Member Node provided provenance information.
* The client software and user interface must be DataONE-enabled and provenance-aware.
* The synthetic and primary dataset(s) have been indexed by the DataONE Coordinating Nodes
* The synthetic and primary dataset(s) need to be accessible to that authenticated user or the public.


Postconditions
--------------
* The scientist can understand the provenance links and can download the primary and derived datasets.
