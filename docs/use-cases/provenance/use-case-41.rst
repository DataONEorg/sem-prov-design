DataONE Use Case 41
===================

------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists can provide tracking information about derived products
------------------------------------------------------------------

Revisions

Goal
----
In DataONE-enabled client software, investigators can easily provide tracking information as they create new products from existing data files.


Summary
-------
Investigators can upload derived datasets to a Member Node and provide traceable links to the primary resources used to create them. Within scientific analysis environments (particularly R and Matlab), scientists can choose which input datasets to track in their workflow scripts, and can manage the product outputs of each run.

Actors
------
* Investigator
* Client software
* Member Node
* Coordinating Node

Preconditions
-------------
* The primary resource dataset needs to be registered on the Member Node.
* The Investigator needs write access to a Member Node.
* The client software must be DataONE-enabled and provenance-aware.

Postconditions
--------------
* The derived datasets are stored on the Member Node
* The data package includes formal links between the primary and derived datasets

Notes
-----

Use Case Implementation Examples
--------------------------------

* An R Client example of Use Case 41 (Scientists can provide tracking information about derived products):

    #``(… create DataONE data objects and a DataONE data package…)``

    ``insertRelationship(data.package, id.result, c(id.script), "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov",      "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasGeneratedBy")``

    ``insertRelationship(data.package, id.script, c(id.data), "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov", "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#used")``

    ``insertRelationship(data.package, id.data, c(id.data2, id.data3), "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov", "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom")``

    ``createDataPackage(d1client, data.package)``
