Goal
----
Scientist can track, list and examine script executions

.. sidebar:: Scenario
    
    "As a data analyst using R or Matlab, I want to keep track of my data input files, data output files and scripts so I can review and compare my runs and the data products they produced."

Summary
-------
The analyst specifies a script (or program, function, etc., as appropriate for their computing environment) for which provenance information will be collected. 
The script is then executed and the input datasets, derived datasets and execution environment attributes that are to be tracked are automatically determined 
and the provenance relationships between these objects is persisted on the local machine. Data products such as analysis output, graphical output, etc.,
that are created by an execution are copied to a local archive.

The scientist can then list recorded script executions, possibly filtering the list by attributes such as execution date and time.
From this list individual executions can be selected for detailed review, such as viewing the provenance relationships between items
and inspecting each data product produced by the execution.

The scientist can then select an execution that has produced the desired data producs, and send them to DataONE 
as detailed in use case #45 (Publish to DataONE).

Actors
------
* Investigator
* Client Software

The following diagram shows a script execution on a client machine where a single dataset is read
and the associated provenance 
relationship between the script and the input dataset is captured. This dataset is 
then used to create a derived dataset, then the provenance relationship between the script and derived dataset is recorded.

Preconditions
-------------
* The necessary DataONE run manager packages have been installed
  
Triggers
--------
* Scientist invokes the run manager record() function, providing their script name
* Scientist invokes the run manager list() function, providing search terms to select matching executions
* Scientist invokes the run manager view() function, providing a package identifier

Post Conditions
---------------
* The scientist has created one or more derived datasets.
* The DataONE run manager has stored provenance information locally for the newly created derived datasets.
* The DataONE run manager has archived derived datasets locally so they will not be overwritten by subsequent runs
