MsTMIP Example Data and Scripts
===============================

This folder is is used to collect example files from researchers participating in the MsTMIP project.  We'd like to see examples of the following files:

1) Example driver data (raw form, not processed yet)

2) Example Matlab, R, Python, or other scripts used in processing driver data.  These would correspond to the ingest, qa/qc, and standardization steps of processing.

3) Example standardized model output data used in model intercomparison analyses
