Goal
----
In DataONE-enabled client software, investigators can easily publish new products from existing data files and provide tracking information.

.. sidebar:: Scenario
    
    "As a data analyst using R or Matlab, I want to publish my data and their history so I can share them with colleagues through an established DataONE repository."

Summary
-------
In both R and Matlab, investigators can upload derived datasets to a DataONE Member Node repository.  They can assign citable identifiers to  their dataset (e.g., a DOI), and provide traceable links to the primary datasets used to create them.

Actors
------
* Investigator
* Client software
* Member Node
* Coordinating Node

Preconditions
-------------
* The primary resource dataset needs to be registered on the Member Node.
* The Investigator needs write access to a Member Node.
* The client software must be DataONE-enabled and provenance-aware.
* The client software has been configured appropriately 

Postconditions
--------------
* The derived datasets are stored on the Member Node
* The data package includes formal links between the primary and derived datasets
